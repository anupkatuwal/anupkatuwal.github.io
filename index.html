						<h1>Anup Katuwal's Portfolio</h1>
						
						<p>welcome to my portfolio! As a graduate student(currently working on final thesis defense) with a passion for data science, Natural Language Processing, 
							and web development. My work reflects a dedication to exploring and creating meaningful applications in these fields. 
							With a focus on enhancing user experiences, I aim to develop projects that are not only technically sound but also elegant 
							and interactive. In my journey as a college grad so far, I have delved into various aspects of Artificial Intelligence, data analysis, and software development,
							creating projects that range from sentiment analysis models to dynamic, user-friendly web applications. 
							
							My goal is to build solutions that bridge technical complexity with intuitive design, making information and tools accessible to everyone.
							This portfolio showcases a range of projects, interactive visualizations,
							and a sleek, customizable web platform that I built from the ground up. Each project reflects my commitment to learning, 
							innovation, and the drive to use technology for positive impact. I invite you to explore my work and see how my skills and 
							interests align with real-world solutions.I have been exploring and learning about this fascinating field for quite some time now. 
							I have worked as a restaurant manager, teaching assistant, and IT Consulatant for an US company remotely. I am excited to share with you some of the 
							projects and skills that I have developed throughout my academic journey. Through my coursework and personal projects, 
							I have gained experience in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using tools such as Python, R, and SQL <br />

									<h2><a href="https://github.com/akatuwal1/springbootPractice/tree/master">My short academic background:<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>I completed my Undergrad in the US with a Computer Information Systems degree. I started learning C++ and <br />
									then the journey of learning programming languages started, even though at the time i had not much idea what i was 
									doing. My academic experience helped me learn other languages like Java, Visual Basic .Net, Javascript.<br />
								Today I can and i am confident that i can learn any languages if i put enough effort. I am good at Mathematics and learning 
							Discrete Maths made many things clearer like Logic and Predicates, Graphs, FSA and more in my programming journey.
						Moving forward I am going to do certificaton courses on Data Science and do projects following various awesome fellows who put stuff online. 
					I must say watching videos and tutorials on Youtube makes me wanna learn and as a Information engineer i understand this learnig has to continue to
					do better.
					I am working on my thesis which is related to NLP, as I really enjoy learning how computers can automate human like understanding of our language, which 
					is one of the most challenging task in the field of AI. But recent developments has shown something amazing, yes i am talking about the 
					ChatGPT. I believe this has open up so many opportunities in the coming future. I am so excited that AI is now acutally going to be the next big 
					thing in technology.

									<p>Data exploration is the process of analyzing and understanding data to extract meaningful insights and identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data. 
										It is an important step in the data analysis process, as it helps to identify potential issues and biases in the data, 
										as well as inform the selection of appropriate statistical models and methods for further analysis.

									<p>In this small project I showed how easily pre-trained language models can be implemented and i am using pyton here.
										The accuracy of the model was above 90% without any fine tuning. The purpose of this project was to show how easily 
										one can use the state of the art BERT pretrained language for Sentiment analysis in my case.
